# Homelab | Infrastructure | Network Security | Security Operations
This repo will showcase my own dedicated homelab that is setup through VirtualBox.

I recently competed in a blue team infrastructure competition known as CNY Hackathon, and I had a very fun experience competeting. So much so, that I wanted to create my own lab so I can do it again.

Here I will be writing out my documentation on my own home lab, which has an internal and external network. Consisting of the following:

Internal:
- Kali Linux
  - OpenVAS 
- Alpine Linux
  - DNS
- Sparky Linux
  - Web Server
  - SSH Server
  - Files 
- Active Directory
  - Windows Server 2016  
- Router
  - pfSense 
- IDS/IPS
  - Suricata 
  
External:
- Metasploitable VM
- Zeek
- SIEM
  - Gravwell 
- Secondary DNS

*This entire network is ran off of my desktop with VirtualBox*
